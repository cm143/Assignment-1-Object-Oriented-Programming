The purpose of this project was to create a program that can edit the inventory of a dataset using classes and methods.
I was able to make class attributes for the Car class. These were manufacturer, model, year, mileage, engine, transmission, drivetrain, mpg, exterior color, interior color, accident, and car price. The methods for the Car class were Paint, Repair, Reupholster, Drive, and Modify_Price. The class attributes for the Seller class were name, rating, and inventory. The methods for the Seller class were buy and sell. 
I was able to add a limitation to RepairJob that would ask a user to input a valid part if they put anything other than engine, transmission, or drivetrain.
